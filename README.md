## Description 

This is a "burger logger"  app (called "Eat-Da-Burger") that is made with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.

*   Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

*   Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

*   Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

*   This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
